# Posity
 A pure javascript/html and template based posting generator.  

 If you want to add own templates simply open posity.js and copy examples to new ones.  
 Then add new selection fields in the html file.  
 You can use custom fields simply by adding them to the javascript array and your template.  

 Notice: Custom fields must begin with -pg-
